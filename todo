Automate as much as possible. 

split bootstrap.sh into root and user based scripts to deal
with simplifying rvms user based install

remove .sh from bootstrap.sh to provide sane interface

Currently thinking for root a check will be made to confirm
user is actually root for it's activitys

for rvm install the a test will be made for both 'dev' user
and dependencies. 

Automate as much as possible.

interface make be simple as:

sudo bootstrap; bootstrap -rvm

have bootstrap automate the creation of the command to
connect to the aws instance via ssh.
Automate as much as possible.

Provide verbosity for the end user one setting up their paths
provide url for the generated 'repair' command.

Automate as much as possible. 

AUTOMATE EVERYTHING!
